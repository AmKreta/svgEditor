## What all features u get
- The most complex project That I made is React Svg Editor, It's a in Browser Svg Design Tool has many use cases like Logo Designer, PPT, Ui/UX Design tool, have inbuilt components to search and user cliparts across your projects and other tools for adding effects like gradients, filters, shadows etc.
- It includes shapes like Circle, Rectangle, ellipse, Text, Line, Ployline, Polygon, Pencil, Image etc, you can just open this app and start designing whatever u like, all designs will be saved in In Browser Database called IndexedDB.
- You can also group two shapes together and thus create a component like Product Card, Navigation bar, Quotes etc and reuse them across your designs, For adding group shape I had to start the project again from scratch brcause I was using Linear traversal by storing shapes in an array to render shapes, But with groups it was not possible so I had to store elements in a map and render them using Depth First Traversal algorithm of trees.
- You can also add multiple pages to your design project and later run it like a power point presentation.
-The project is made using React.js and Redux and language used is Typescript.
